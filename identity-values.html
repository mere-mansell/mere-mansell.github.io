      <h3>WHO AM I AND WHAT DO I BRING TO THIS LEARNING JOURNEY?</h3>

     <h2>HOW CULTURE INFLUENCES MY VALUES AND IDENTITY</h2>
     <p>I think I can see the influence that my culture has played on my identity and values moreso now that I am older. There is an interesting stigma with being Māori especially one who was somewhat displaced from your culture growing up. That self-critical voice that says, “I’m not good enough, or brown enough or Māori enough”. It’s only now that I’m older that I’ve taken active steps in reconnecting with my culture and have realised how many cultural ideas I have carried with me all these years.</p>
     <p>In Te Ao Māori we have a holistic way of viewing everything, we acknowledge our connections to all things living and non-living. The belief that all things should be taken care of and looked after as to preserve and sustain things for future generations. I believe this is one reason why kindness and treating everything with the same level of respect is so important to me.</p>
     <p>We are a culture that connect through lots of food and face to face connection and stories. A culture that fosters strong relationships and mutual respect for people. I think this relates to my values placed on integrity and humility.</p>
     <p>As I got older I had my eyes opened to the clear inequities faced by Māori on our own whenua. We are over-represented in every bad statistic and under-represented in positive statistics. We are a culture that had been colonised, stripped of their language and land and are now trying to reclaim our identity.</p>

     <h2>MY STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS</h2>
     <p>I am detail orientated, logical, energetic, a quick thinker and original. The limitations of these strengths when it comes to learning is that I’m logical to the point where I want to fully understand how something works, and every possible option and outcome before I make a decision. This means I can be slow to make decisions and inflexible if logic says otherwise.</p>
     <p>Because I am energetic and a quick thinker, I can find it difficult to focus and can get bored or lose interest easily especially if I’m lacking the inspiration for a project I may have initially had.</p>
   </div>

   <div class="position">
     <h2>WHICH STRENGTHS WILL HELP IN MY LEARNING JOURNEY</h2>
     <p>Being detail orientated in code, I believe will be a huge strength. Hopefully it will help me to identify errors and mistakes quickly which would be beneficial in code, especially when code needs to be written in very particular ways.</p>
     <p>Being energetic, original and a quick thinker will be vital in group projects. I am usually pretty enthusiastic about new challenges and like the intellectual stimulation and chance to bring new ideas and pivot from idea to idea without much effort. I think this will help me when it comes to having to brainstorm and create solutions in a very quick timeframe.</p>

     <h2>EXAMPLE WHERE THERE WAS TENSION IN A WORK SETTING</h2>
     <p>In a previous role, we had a team who weren’t feeling supported by management. It was slowly becoming a toxic work environment and people were expressing desires to leave if something didn’t change.</p>
     <p>I am very comfortable challenging a managers ideas or raising issues with people in a position of power. Because of my logical side, I was able to clearly communicate the issues that were appearing and suggestions for new methods of dealing with the team, without sounding like a dick and pointing the finger straight at them. From my perspective, if something can be done better, it’s as simple as that. I will gladly take criticism so long as it’s logical and performance-orientated and believe that the same should apply with others. How would the management better support the team if they didn’t realise that it was an issue or something that could be done better.</p>
     <p>After raising the issue with our manager, it was clear that our manager felt very similar to the team in not being supported by their boss. Also felt as though they were expected to manage a team who didn’t respect their opinions while also not having someone support them from above.</p>
     <p>Things got much better after this discussion.</p>
