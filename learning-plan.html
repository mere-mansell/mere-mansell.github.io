      <h3>HOW WILL I OPERATE WITHIN FOUNDATIONS AND BOOTCAMP</h3> 
   </div> 

   <div class="position">
     <h2>WHAT IS YOUR CAREER GOAL?</h2>
     <p>I’ve never really been someone who can clearly picture, verbalise or identify what I envision for my future. It’s been really good for enabling me to jump at opportunities to learn new skills, but not the best in terms of having a solid aim or something to concretely work towards.</p>
     <p>The more I try out new things, the easier it is for me to decide if I enjoy something or not and if I want it to be a part of my future. After working in my last role, I know I would really like a career that offered remote working where I can be a part of a team from the comfort of where ever I am.</p>
     <p>I had always had an interest in coding and my unclear career pathway and keen, up for the challenge mentality jumped at the chance to learn web development, acquire a new skill and see if it can provide a career pathway for me.</p>
     <p class="brown-back">End of Sprint 5: Honestly not sure yet. I want to work in an environment that aligns with my values and supports my idea of a work/life balance. I would like to work on projects where I feel like I am contributing to something meaningful and impactful. Something to contribute to positive outcomes for Māori would be amazing. Dev, am I pretty much describing a job with you guys? ;)</p>
   </div>

   <div class="position">
     <h2>MY STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES</h2>
     <p>I am detail orientated, logical, energetic, a quick thinker and original. The limitations of these strengths when it comes to learning is that I’m logical to the point where I want to fully understand how something works, and every possible option and outcome before I make a decision. This means I can be slow to make decisions and inflexible if logic says otherwise.</p>
     <p>Because I am energetic and a quick thinker, I can find it difficult to focus and can get bored or lose interest easily especially if I’m lacking the inspiration for a project I may have initially had.</p>
     <p class="brown-back">End of Sprint 5: My idea around these hasn’t changed much since the beginning of Foundations, however, they may change and develop throughout bootcamp. A limitation that I really need to challenge during Bootcamp is my confidence and being brave enough to try despite whether or not a solution will work. I’m still a bit hesitant with things because I still see myself as a beginner.</p>
   </div>

   <div class="position">
     <h2>WHAT NON-TECH SKILLS DO I WANT TO DEVELOP?</h2>
     <p>I am brand new to coding and web develop so I came into Dev really focussed on learning the technical side of the programme. However, in my two weeks of foundations so far I have already seen I have a huge amount to gain on the human skills aspect as well.</p>
     <p>Time management is something I have always struggled to get right, but with Dev I have noticed that this becomes critical as to not get left behind with the intensive workload.</p>
     <p>Learning how to prioritise and balance a heavy workload with outside influences will be interesting too. Just seeing how I will cope mentally and emotionally if things start to get hectic will be a learning process.</p>
     <p class="brown-back">End of Sprint 5: There were definitely times during Foundations where I felt tired and run down but was still able to manage the workload. I’m worried about staying on top of the workload in Bootcamp and keeping energised and motivated for 9 weeks. I don’t want to burn out, but the workload is super intensive, so this will be something I need to assess weekly and see how I’m coping. I really want to develop my self-awareness and reflective skills and make it something I do regularly. I’m really going to work on implementing the strategies of core and have a daily practice of self-check in and reflection at the end beginning and end of the day.</p>
   </div>

   <div class="position">
     <h2>HOW WILL I MANAGE MY WORKLOAD?</h2>
     <p>Setting and getting habitual with a routine is going to be really key to staying on top of things in bootcamp and ensuring that I spend enough time engaging with the workload, sleeping, eating well and exercising.</p>
     <p>Even though this programme is super intensive, I really want to make sure I am balancing it with my pillars of health (sleep, eating, connection with others, exercise, contributing to others). I believe if I can dedicate adequate time to things outside of this programme, it will help me perform at my best during bootcamp.</p>
     <p>Little things like making a clear time that I will dedicate to code and a clear time that I will shut off for the evening. Having a bedtime and a wake time and setting these intentionally to ensure I can fit in a gym workout or walk and making nutritious food in my day. I want to be committing at minimum 50-60hours a week to code during bootcamp.</p>
     <p>I have a study space in my home and my whānau are well aware of the commitments required for this course and are supportive of my space. I also have access to study spaces outside of my place if I need a change of scenery.</p>
     <p>Other things I will need to schedule into my days include the nights where I cook dinner, driving to and from co-working space and time to practice my te reo Māori which is a huge priority in my life.</p>
     <p class="brown-back">End of Sprint 5: I have set up my work space to ensure that I have somewhere to work productively during bootcamp. I purchased a second screen so that coding and follow-alongs will be easier for me. For the next 9 weeks, things will just need to become routine. My plan is to be up every day at 6am to start the day with a walk, breakfast and some self-reflection and goal setting for the day before class starts at 9am.
       <br><br>During lunch time, it’s really important to me to switch off and focus on something else, and for me that is practicing my te reo Māori. I hope to be finished majority of my daily tasks at 6pm as I would still like to be available to help with dinner if I can. However, I know that this will not be a possibility every night and am okay coding longer as long as I am done and shut off for the night at about 10/10.30pm. Again, this is something that I will need to reassess as we progress through bootcamp. I know the workload is intensive but it’s a bit hard to envision what that will actually look like for 9 weeks. Everyone in my life knows that I am starting bootcamp and everyone is really supportive and understanding going into the next two months that I’ll be super busy and not available as much as I am now during foundations.
       <br><br>It's quite scary and I’m really hoping I’ll be able to keep up with the workload, so putting systems in place is very important for success.

     <h2>WHEN I NEED HELP</h2>
     <p>When I run into issues my first point of action is to always see if I can figure it out using google or youtube or searching the discord to see if someone else has had the same issue before.</p>
     <p>However, I understand that while this is good, spending too much time researching for a solution can actually prove counter intuitive and so setting a timeframe to allow for research before asking is a good idea. For example, “I’ll try to figure it out for 25minutes, if I haven’t in that time I will ask the facilitation team for guidance."</p>
     <p>I expect the facilitation team to point me in the right direction or challenge my thinking to find a possible solution without directly fixing something for me. I also expect the facilitation team to be empathetic and understanding when it comes to timeframes and potential outside impacts out of our control.</p>
     <p class="brown-back">End of Sprint 5: Based on bootcamp, I feel more confident reaching out for help if I need assistance quicker. For example, if I am stuck on a problem for more than 30mins, I will reach out for some guidance.
       <br><br>I expect the bootcamp team to be encouraging, supportive, understanding and gentle with me. I don’t expect full answers or hand-holding, but learning code is quite scary for me and I’m definitely feeling outside of my comfort zone. So when learning, I expect gentle responses and aids when I make mistakes. When someone’s learning it’s really easy to be discouraged from wanting to continue learning, so I hope if I do make mistakes people will be gentle and patient with me.</p>
