      <h2>NEUROPLASTICITY</h2>
      <p>Neuroplasticity essentially refers to the brain’s ability to change and adapt to new things through experience. The brain is made up of billions of neurons and when we learn something new or have a new experience we create connections between these neurons. This also enables us to rewire our brains which can help up adapt new circumstances. This happens every day without much conscious effort, but it is something we can encourage.</p>
      <p>Every time we have a new experience or practice something, some of these neuron connections are strengthened. At the same time the connections that are rarely used or never used will eventually die. By strengthening connections and removing weak ones, the brain is able to slowly adapt and change over time.</p>
      <p>When you practice a skill or even access a memory, those neuron connections are fired up. The more you practice, the more these connections are strengthened. Even thinking about practicing a skill or visualising yourself performing the skill can fire up these connections.</p>
      <p>For me, this has highlighted the importance of practice when it comes to learning code. Making sure I practice daily will help strength the neurons responsible for coding. It has also highlighted how important other things are to helping me improve my coding including regular exercise, sleep, reading. Even though some things may seem counter-intuitive, they can actually help without me realising.</p>
      <p>Ways to encourage neuroplasticity:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Travelling</li>
        <li>Memory games</li>
        <li>Learning a language</li>
        <li>Learning an instrument</li>
        <li>Reading</li>
        <li>Creating art</li>
        <li>Getting enough sleep</li>
        <li>Exercising</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>GROWTH MINDSET</h2>
      <p>Your mindset can not only determine how you view yourself or your abilities but can go on to impact what we achieve, if we’ll try new things, how well we stick to habits and goals and if we will develop new skills.</p>
      <p>A growth mindset means that you believe your skill can be developed overtime and that you can get better at things whereas a fixed mindset believes the opposite. If you can’t do something that’s that.</p>
      <p>If someone has a growth mindset, usually they understand that not being good at something can just be temporary and they can improve that skill if they put in effort to learning and developing that skill. This also means that they don’t have to feel ashamed about something as they are prepared to focus on changing it.</p>
      <p>For me this has helped me put into perspective my journey with coding. I had next to no coding experience coming into Dev Academy and although I still feel like an imposter at times, I know that I will learn and grow this skillset and not being able to code is just temporary. I am not trying to prove to anyone that I am an amazing coder, I am just trying to learn more than yesterday. Each learning and challenge is exciting and each set back is just a part of the process.</p>
      <p>Every time I feel like I can’t do it, I just need to remind myself that I am capable of doing it, I just need to find the method that works for me. Changing the language I use has really helped. Instead of saying “I can’t do this it’s too hard, what if I suck at coding and everyone laughs” I have started saying “This is really challenging, I am finding it difficult and that is totally okay. I may not have the solution right now, but I am learning heaps and hopefully I’ll get there”.</p>
