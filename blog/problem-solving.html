      <h2>RECAP OF WEEK 4</h2>
      <p>This week I got stuck on a problem where I was sure my code ‘should’ be working and doing what I need it to do to pass the tests that were set for it, however, for the life of me I could not figure out why it wasn’t working.</p>
      <p>Usually when this happens to me I get really frustrated and self-critical which makes me question my ability to learn code because I have no idea where my code is going wrong. Have I misunderstood what I’m trying to do? Am I structuring my code incorrectly and using incorrect methods? Am I trying to get it to do the wrong thing? Am I so far from the right track that there’s no hope for return? Or have I done 99% of it correctly and is it something really simple that’s right in front of eyes?</p>
      <p>So this time, when I encountered this problem I tried to implement different problem solving techniques.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="position">
      <h2>PSEUDOCODE</h2>
      <p>Pseudocode is where you put comments into your code that tell you how your code should eventually work or what you are trying to do at each point. They can be steps of your code’s outline and help by letting you break your code down into smaller more achievable steps so you can focus on one thing at a time. It’s essentially leaving instructions all throughout your code for yourself or another programme.</p>
      <p>I really like pseudocoding as it gives me something to focus on, follow and aim for. I pseudocoded the instructures for what I was trying to do and made sure I had ticked everything off my pseudocode.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="position">
      <h2>TRYING SOMETHING</h2>
      <p>As the name suggests, this is just when you try something and see what happens. I did this by adding in things that I thought might help, then deleting things that I thought could be blocking my code from working.</p>
      <p>This was a good thing to try, but in this case didn’t work and didn’t help me get any closer to understanding what was wrong. Just made me narrow down what wasn’t right.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="position">
      <h2>THE RUBBER DUCKY METHOD</h2>
      <p>Essentially this is just speaking your code, what it’s meant to do and the steps you are taking out loud. A rubber duck is a good listener.</p>
      <p>I did try this (although I don’t have a rubber duck – perhaps that’s why it didn’t work for me), however reading it the method behind my code out loud only reaffirmed that I was in fact on the right track. Didn’t help me fix my code, however it did help to quiet that voice of frustration and self-doubt in my head. And because I was confident that I was on the right track, I actually didn’t feel too frustrated about the situation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="position">
      <h2>READING ERROR MESSAGES</h2>
      <p>I did try to read the error messages but I need to get better at this. The error messages were quite vague and I couldn’t really decipher what they were trying to tell me. All I could understand was that my code was failing and I already knew that.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="position">
      <h2>ASKING FOR HELP</h2>
      <p>So after a decent amount of time wracking my brain trying to find where it had all gone wrong, I decided to post on discord and ask my fellow coders for some help. This typically is something I’ve found myself quite hesitant to do. I don’t want to feel like a burden to anyone and because I am a beginner coder, I don’t want to come across as clueless (imposter syndrome I guess).</p>
      <p>About 30mins after posting my help request, an angel (fellow coder Luis) came down from the heavens and told me that my code looked great, I just needed to double check my spelling. I went back to my code and instantly saw what Luis was talking about. In one piece of code rather than .length I had coded .legnth.</p>
      <p>Sometimes you stare at code and the font of code too long that even correctly spelt words look wrong. Thank you Luis!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="position">
      <h2>WHAT DID I LEARN?</h2>
      <p>That before I let my frustration get the best of me, going through the process of problem solving using these different techniques really helps to feel like even though I may not know what’s wrong, I am actively working towards trying to figure it out.</p>
      <p>That reaching out to your peers and mentors for a second set of eyes can save you a huge amount of time you could’ve been sitting there trying to save your ego and not progressing any further.</p>
      <p>Spelling and grammar are really important, really easily to screw up and really easy to overlook when trying to find something that is causing your code not to work as it should be.</p>
