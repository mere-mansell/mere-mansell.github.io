      <h3>MY JOURNEY THROUGH CORE SKILLS </h3>

      <h2>WHAT ARE 3 THINGS I LEARNT ABOUT MYSELF DURING CORE?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I realised over the course of foundations that I am able to get in to the flow of coding and Dev Academy really really easily. The only time I find it slightly difficult is when I am stuck and don’t know where I’ve gone wrong, then I feel frustrated and self-critical that I don’t know what I don’t know.</li>
        <li>Foundations has really made me check my ego and stop and realise that it’s okay to not know the answer or not know everything and just in time learning is okay.</li>
        <li>That it’s really easy to fall into a fixed mindset, especially when you are pushed outside of your comfort zone and into a new experience. But this is where the big learning comes in. If you can see that fear/anxiety as excitement to tackle something new, then you could potentially have huge growth. I caught myself falling into a fixed mindset multiple times during foundations just questioning if I am really capable of becoming a programmer. But catching it and changing your mindset is a good first step. If you can overcome that, then at least you don’t quit and stop the opportunity there.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>WHAT ARE THE ROLES OF VALUES, EMPATHY AND SELF AWARENESS IN PROGRAMMING?</h2>
      <p>Everyone is going through something. Everyone has their own shit going on just like us and there’s no real way to tell what someone has on their mental. Having values, empathy and self-awareness helps you interact with you co-programmers. Checking in with your values will help you identify if you want to work on a project, or with people based on their values or the values of the project. Having empathy will make you a decent person who is understanding and gentle with the fact that people have lives and shit going on outside of this one interaction with you in this very moment. Being more self-aware can help you develop as a programmer, help you take responsibility for mistakes, identify when your being closed minded or fixed and when you’re other stuff may be affecting your work.</p>

      <h2>WHAT SURPRISED YOU THE MOST ABOUT THE CORE LEARNING?</h2> 
      <p>I was most surprised at how useful I found the time boxing and toggl elements throughout foundations. This was something introduced in core but something that really impacted both my core and tech learning. I found myself way more productive and was able to hold myself more accountable when using toggl and the timeboxing suggestions. I am a pressure prompted worker, which I think would help in Sprint situations, and the toggl and timeboxing helped me allocate a “deadline” to each aspect of the sprint and not just saying “oh we have 1 week for sprint 1”. If I managed to get everything done in the recommended time, it also really encouraged me to jump into the next activity. Definitely something I want to implement in the future to everything!</p>

    <div class="position">
      <h2>WHAT WERE THE MOST CHALLENGING PARTS OF THE CORE LEARNING?</h2> 
      <p>One of the most challenging things for me was making aspects of the core learning habitual. I still am struggling to fully implement it without having to think about it. Taking that time to sit and be mindful at the start of everyday and assess what are the things I want to achieve today, and doing the same at the end of the day and asking what went well today. This tends to be something I overlook easily, I get stuck straight into code, or I wake up and am running late, or get stuck in the flow of code that when I switch off I switch straight off and into bed.</p>
      <p>I think prioritising core learning was challenging as well. I knew that the Tech aspect of foundations was the part I really had to dedicate a lot of time to focussing on because I came into this with little tech experience but I feel like I had done a bit of the core work in prior jobs. But understanding that core wasn’t something to zoom through or leave till the end in order to push the emphasis on tech was challenging.</p>

      <h2>WHY DO I THINK DEV ACADEMY SPENDS SO MUCH TIME ON CORE LEARNING?</h2>
      <p>As you guys have said to us many times, working in tech is a huge amount of collaborative, creative, solution driven problem solving and in order to create great solutions, one has to be a decent human being who can contribute to the team culture and actually make people want to work with them. Someone can be a beautiful perfect coder, but if you aren’t empathetic or you’re just a dick, then yea nah I’d rather not have you on my team. Thanks, but no thanks.</p>
      <p>I think Dev focuses on this skill set, as it’s not something typically focussed on in traditional tertiary providers, therefor hopefully building something that sets or grads apart from other grads, gives us a bit of an advantage when entering the workplace and hopefully increasing the number of actual decent human beings in teams which will then go full circle and just make everything better. Nice job Dev!</p>

      <h2>DID THE CORE LEARNING FEEL LIKE A WASTE OF TIME?</h2>
      <p>I think studying core learning was a really necessary part of foundations and absolutely not a waste of my time. Not only did I learn heaps of stuff which to be honest, I didn’t think I would, but as a baby foetus coder, it was really nice to have something embedded into the sprints that I was confident I could complete. Like if everything with the tech learning went to shit and I started drowning, at least I could see the core learning as something I would be able to do as it’s a lot of researching, reading, watching and self-reflection.  I can see how working in sprint environments could really easily create this unbalanced or intensive workload and I think being reminded early that we should be prioritising self-reflection and mindfulness and a break and breath of fresh air was awesome to see.</p>
